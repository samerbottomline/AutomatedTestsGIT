[11616:20580:0723/160803.056:INFO:CONSOLE(44)] "Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-DzmblnJ6LLp7S9uj4ccM7lOnrztK3uoMZpqIQ2vI8Bw='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution. Note that hashes do not apply to event handlers, style attributes and javascript: navigations unless the 'unsafe-hashes' keyword is present. Note also that 'style-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
