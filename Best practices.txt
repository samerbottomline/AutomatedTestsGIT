There are a few best practices in using page objects, that we should make an effort to follow.

+++ A page object should not have any assertions (page objects are stricly under com.bottomline.pages package)
+++ A page object should represent meaningful elements of a page and not necessarily a complete page 
+++ When you navigate you should return the a page object for the next page
